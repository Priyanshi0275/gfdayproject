    <p>We started as friends, just two souls finding their way in a crowded world but our friendship grew effortlessly, a bond forged in laughter and shared secrets. We were inseparable, partners in crime, and confidants. We spent countless hours talking about everything and nothing, dreaming about the future and navigating the twists and turns of adolescence together. It was during those moments, in the midst of our daily lives, that something more began to bloom. What started as friendship evolved into something deeper, something beautiful.When the time came to choose colleges, it felt natural to take the next step together. Today, as we celebrate Girlfriend's Day, I look back with a heart full of gratitude. We’ve weathered storms and celebrated victories, our journey marked by a tapestry of memories that we’ve woven together.</p>
